## Reverse Shell
In a typical remote system access scenario, the user is the client and the target machine is the server. The user initiates a remote shell connection and the target system listens for such connections. With a reverse shell, the roles are opposite. It is the target machine that initiates the connection to the user, and the userâ€™s computer listens for incoming connections on a specified port.

## Setup Server
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python server.py
## Setup Client
It's suggested to export the client.py in exe using autopytoexe

- python client.py
